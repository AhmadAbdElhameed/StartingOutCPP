/*
Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use a
loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the
user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.
Input Validation: Do not accept an input that is less than 1.
