/*
Personal Best

Write a program that asks for the name of a pole vaulter and the dates and vault heights (in
meters) of the athleteâ€™s three best vaults. It should then report in height order (best first),
the date on which each vault was made, and its height.

	Input Validation: Only accept values between 2.0 and 5.0 for the heights.
