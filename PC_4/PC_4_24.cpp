Using Filesâ€”Internet Service Provider Part 3

Months with 30 days have 720 hours, and months with 31 days have 744 hours. February,
with 28 days, has 672 hours. Enhance the input validation of the Internet Service Provider
program by asking the user for the month (by name), and validating that the number of
hours entered is not more than the maximum for the entire month. Here is a table of the
months, their days, and number of hours in each
