Wrapping Ups and Downs
Modify the program you wrote for Programming Challenge 5, so that after disappearing
off of the screen, the word UP reappears at the bottom of the screen and the word DOWN
reappears at the top of the screen. The words should continue moving until the user presses
the [Enter] key to terminate the program.
