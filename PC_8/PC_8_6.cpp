/*
Lottery

Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an array of 5 integers
named winningDigits, with a randomly generated number in the range of 0 through 9
for each element in the array. The program should ask the user to enter 5 digits and should
store them in a second integer array named player. The program must compare the corresponding
elements in the two arrays and count how many digits match. For example, the
following shows the winningDigits array and the Player array with sample numbers
stored in each. There are two matching digits, elements 2 and 4.

	 WinningDigits 7 4 9 1 3
			player 4 2 9 7 3

Once the user has entered a set of numbers, the program should display the winning digits
and the playerâ€™s digits and tell how many digits matched.

	Input validation: Do not accept player inputs less than 0 or greater than 9.
